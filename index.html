          Giraffe, (genus Giraffa), any of four species in the genus Giraffa of
          long-necked cud-chewing hoofed mammals of Africa, with long legs and a
          coat pattern of irregular brown patches on a light background.
          Giraffes are the tallest of all land animals; males (bulls) may exceed
          5.5 metres (18 feet) in height, and the tallest females (cows) are
          about 4.5 metres. Using prehensile tongues almost half a metre long,
          they are able to browse foliage almost six metres from the ground.
          Giraffes are a common sight in grasslands and open woodlands in East
          Africa, where they can be seen in reserves such as Tanzania's
          Serengeti National Park and Kenya's Amboseli National Park. The genus
          Giraffa is made up of the northern giraffe (G. camelopardalis), the
          southern giraffe (G. giraffa), the Masai giraffe (G. tippelskirchi),
          and the reticulated giraffe (G. reticulata).

          The alligator is about as close as one can get to seeing a modern-day
          dinosaur.
        </p>
        <p>
          Early alligator ancestors appeared more than 200 million years ago
          and, approximately 80 years ago, crocodilians (the group that
          encompasses alligators, crocodiles, caimans and gharials) appeared
          during the Cretaceous period.
        </p>
        <p>
          The term “alligator” translates into a Spanish word that means
          “lizard”. There are two species of alligator in the world—the American
          alligator and the Chinese alligator.
